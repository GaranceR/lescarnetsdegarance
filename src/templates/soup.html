    In a large pan, fry the onions in oil until translucent and soft. Add
    squash and carrots and stir, cooking for a further 5 minutes. Add thyme and
    season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour over stock and
    bring to boil. Allow to simmer gently for 30 minutes, or until vegetables
    are cooked through.</p><p>
    Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Using a hand blender or a
    liquidiser, blend to a smooth soup. If too thick, add a little more stock
    until desired consistency is achieved.</p><p>
    Divide soup into bowls and serve with a dollop of cr√®me fraiche and
    parsley.
